\section{Discussion}

From a merely technical perspective, following implementation we believe that the platform confirmed the potential to achieve the same scalability and availability that the third party services it relies on are capable of.

Conversely, the decision not to deploy custom software components for crowdsourcing and rather rely exclusively on CrowdFlower's native functionality forced us to work around many of their design characteristics. This affected negatively the performance of the overall system to a point compromising its effectiveness and nullifying the advantages. For example, not having the possibility to rely on CrowdFlower's own model for assessing consensus (size of consensus vs Fleiss' kappa) forced us in turn not to use their features that stop Workers to judge more than once the same item, hence causing the overwhelming volume of unwanted, repeated judgements. 


The inconsistencies between our crowdsourcing model design and what CrowdFlower made possible were many, from *** to ****. 


An equally pressing issue is the choice of crowdsourcing task. Its complexity and open-ended nature failed to catalyse effectively the contributors' agreement around results that are statistically credible. This also suggested that our concern around survey activities of this sort not being suitable to reproduce the success microtasking can achieve in other settings. Gottlieb {\it et al.} in \cite{Gottlieb:2012fh} faced similar difficulty, e.g. in exploring crowdsourcing to geolocate places in videos.

Finally, even if we were successful, any discussion should still be filtered through a cost / benefit examination: what is a "reasonable cost" of producing one address with a target degree of confidence? Has a solution based on anything but VGI any opportunity to be cost effective? We may find that out the complexity of producing and maintaining an address file, to paraphrase the UK law, actually makes PAF's licensing price "reasonable".
