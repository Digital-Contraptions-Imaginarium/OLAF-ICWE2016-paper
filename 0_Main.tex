[YOU'RE READING A VERSION COMPILED AT \currenttime ON \today.]

Until a few years ago, the creation and maintenance of geospatial data inevitably meant deploying expert personnel to survey the locations, with substantial cost and effort. As more open data is published by governments and organisations, new opportunities arise to create data products and services from integrating pre-existing sources with ad hoc additions.

Human contribution is still central to the creation of original data, and automation cannot address all the challenges, such as replacing us in most surveying tasks. However, we have now the opportunity to create hybrid human-machine workflows in which re-using open data, computation and crowdsourcing enable and enhance each other's output. 

In this paper we present WODA (Workflows for Open Data Augmentation): an experimental platform implementing this hybrid model. In the attempt to maximise cost-effectiveness, scalability and availability of the technology component, we design WODA to rely only on the native features of a chosen crowdsourcing platform: CrowdFlower. 

WODA is then applied to a real world use case: the creation of a dataset of all valid UK addresses, starting from available open data, augmenting it through computational inference and complementing it by using paid microtask crowdsourcing. 

Experimental evaluation shows the feasibility, effectiveness and challenges of the approach.
