\begin{abstract}
As more open data is published by governments and organisations, the task of creating new data evolves from being a ground-up process - where data is collected and shaped from scratch - to an enhancement process, where pre-existing sources and original additions merge into new, valuable data products. 

Machine learning, computer vision and automation in general can't (yet?) address all challenges in this area, and available data, computation and original contributions by human participants - e.g. through crowdsourcing - need integration and enabling each other through hybrid human-machine workflows. 

In this paper we present an experimental platform that implements this model, aimed specifically at the creation of geospatial data. The platform is then applied to a real world use case: the creation of "OLAF", an open dataset of all valid UK addresses, starting from available open data and augmenting it through computational inference and microtask crowdsourcing. Experimental evaluation show the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.
