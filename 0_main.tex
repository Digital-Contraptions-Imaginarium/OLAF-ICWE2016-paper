\begin{abstract}
As more open data is published by governments and organisations, the task of creating new data evolves from being a ground-up process - where data is collected and shaped from scratch - to an enhancement process, where pre-existing sources and original additions merge into new, valuable data products. 

Machine learning, computer vision and automation in general can't (yet?) address all challenges in this area, and available data, computation and original contributions by human participants - e.g. through crowdsourcing - need integration and enabling each other through hybrid human-machine workflows. 

In this paper we present a possible application of this model, and setup a platform to deal with a real world use case: the creation of "OLAF", an open dataset of all valid UK addresses, starting from available open geospatial data and augmenting it through computational inference and crowdsourcing. Experimental evaluation show the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item RESEARCH QUESTION, DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE FINAL EXPERIMENTS ARE STILL MISSING. WHAT CAN BE DONE THAT IS INTERESTING, RELEVANT TO RESEARCH AND FITS THE TIME AVAILABLE?
        \end{itemize}
    \item WEAKNESSES 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item STRONG FOCUS ON USE CASE, POOR GENERALISATION, BUT IS IT NECESSARY?, GIVEN THE CONFERENCE'S EXPLICIT INTEREST IN "Use cases and experiences with human computing and crowdsourcing applications" \url{http://icwe2016.inf.usi.ch/topics#crowd}
            \item ARGUABLE CHOICE OF NOT USING GOLD TESTS
            \item I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE "SOCIAL MACHINE MIX" I PRESENT, BUT THAT SHOULD PROBABLY BE A PAPER OF ITS OWN, UNLESS I CAN FIND SOMEONE WHO DEVELOPED THE SUBJECT BEFORE ME
            \item WON'T HAVE TIME TO DEVELOP ROBUST STATISTICAL DISCUSSION OF THE RESULT, E.G. EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION OF THE WORKER SUBMISSIONS, POSSIBILITY TO USE THAT TO DETECT ANOMALIES ETC., LOTS OF POTENTIAL THERE
            \item I STILL FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE A SUFFICIENT AWARENESS OF LITERATURE AROUND ALL SUBJECTS I TOUCH, THERE COULD BE PAST WORK ABOUT ALMOST EVERYTHING I DISCUSS
            \item QUANTITATIVE PROOF OF THE INFERENCE ALGORITHMS BEING EFFECTIVE (WHAT I WANTED FROM CHECKING THE ORDNANCE SURVEY DATA)
