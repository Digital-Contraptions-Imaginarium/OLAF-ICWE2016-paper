\begin{abstract}
As more open data is published by governments and organisations, the task of creating new open data changes from being a ground-up process - where data is collected and shaped from scratch - to an enhancement process, where pre-existing data sources, computation and original contributions by human participants - e.g. through crowdsourcing - are integrated together and enable each other through hybrid human-machine workflows. In this paper we present a possible application of such processes to a real world use case: the creation of "OLAF", an open address file for the UK. Experimental evaluation show the effectiveness of the approach.
