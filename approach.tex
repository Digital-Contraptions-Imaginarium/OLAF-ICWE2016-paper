\section{Crowdsourcing addresses: our approach}

\subsection{The social machine mix}

    Although the OLAF data is conceptually simple, assembling such a large dataset while assuring sufficient quality is a complex task, even when starting from such valuable pre-existing open data such as Ordnance Survey's offering.
    
    It is our hypothesis that, to make the best use of pre-existing open data and potentially available technology and human resources, such a problem must be decomposed in a series of complementary sub-problems targeting parts of its scope. Each problem, then, can be solved by a socio-technical system designed for that purpose, or social machine. This decomposition can take place over several iterations, hence creating a hierarchy of systems that we will call the "social machine mix".

    \textbf{The central role of pre-existing open data.} 
    
    [THIS IS AN INTERESTING STATEMENT, I WONDER IF IT CAN BE GENERALISED] The main driver determining the possible decompositions of the original problem into a hierarchy of sub-problems is the availability of pre-existing and reliable open data. There are two reasons for that.

    \begin{itemize}

        \item The first and more intuitive reason is an assumption: no social machine can produce data in a more cost-effective way than re-using a pre-published, reliable dataset is.  
        
        Hence, the focus of social machines in the overall mix can only be of two kinds: a) on creating original data where the same cannot be sourced in any other machine-only method, and b) on leveraging those skills where humans outperform machines. The obvious example of this is the survey of the streets, being it in person in the physical world, or by examining pictures of the locations, that is how crowdsourcing is used in the system described later in this paper.

        \item The second reason is that open data can be instrumental to operate a social machine. Even when a dataset is not re-used directly to creating the target output data, it can be used for other functions, e.g. supporting the process by which humans contribute. There will be a clear example of this later in this paper. 

    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope restrictions}
    
    [DOES NOT SOUND LIKE IN THE RIGHT PLACE] 
    
    To make the problem suitable to research it was simplified as described below. 
    
    We will consider only two British countries: England and Wales, as the availability of pre-existing open geospatial data is richer and homogeneous. It is easy to see that the validity of the method proposed in this paper is independent of the geographical region that is the subject of the study, as long is the problem is consistent, e.g. the definition of the address is the same. The moment the same open data used for England and Wales becomes available for Scotland and Northern Ireland, the method can be deployed to produce an UK-wide OLAF without modification.
    
    Within the territory described above, we will perform our experiment only on a sample of the London area. This is the same sample that was used in literature in the past to analyse the performance of other geospatial data crowdsourcing initiatives, e.g. OpenStreetMap in [REFERENCE]. [SOME WORDING FROM THAT PAPER TO STATE HOW WE DID NOT SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM BY DOING THIS BUT JUST REDUCED IT IN SIZE]
    
    \begin{figure*}

    	\caption{This picture should not be here, but apparently it is a nightmare in LaTeX.}
    	\label{fig:london_sample_1}
    \end{figure*}
    
    For simplicity, in the decomposition exercise that follows, only data from authoritative sources is used, such as government bodies', and it is assumed to be of the highest possible quality, equivalent to what could be called {\it ground truth}. It is for this reason that no tasks related to the validation of the open data sources is considered in scope. The datasets are described in more detail in [REFERENCE TO LATER IN THE PAPER].

\subsection{A social machines mix for OLAF}

    The open data available during our research makes it possible to divide the creation of OLAF in two main sub-problems {\it p1} and {\it p2}. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\it p1}: Create a list of all existing house numbers and house names for each road listed in Ordnance Survey's "Open Names".
        \item {\it p2}: Create a list of the associations between each of the house number and names above and the list of current\footnote{Postcodes can change. The problem of documenting how addresses change postcode in time is relevant but outside of the scope of research.} postcodes listed in Ordnance Survey's "Open Names". 
    \end{itemize}

    Open Names "lists definitive place names, roads numbers and postcodes in Great Britain"\footnote{See \url{https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-names.html}.}. It was central to the research work as it is dataset that is functionally closer to the target. OLAF is - in practical terms - equivalent to adding just one dimension to Open Names, that is the list of house names and number for each of its roads.

    Problem {\it p2} is not discussed in this paper. 
    
    Problem {\it p1} can be further decomposed, thanks to the availability of additional open data sources:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\it p1.1}: Collect the list of house numbers and house names for each existing road as they are referenced in Land Registry's "Price Paid".
        \item {\it p1.2}: Statistically infer the existence of house numbers from the house numbers collected above.
        \item {\it p1.3}: Enable the application of {\it p1.2} through surveying.
        \item {\it p1.4}: Correct the output of {\it p1.2} through surveying.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{{\it p1.1}: Collect the list of house numbers and house names for each existing road as they are referenced in Land Registry's "Price Paid".} 

        References to existing house names and numbers can be found in a few open data publications in the UK. The largest in size is the "Price Paid Data" by the Land Registry: a non-ministerial Government department with the responsibility to register the ownership of land and property in England and Wales. Data for each ownership transfer since 1995 - and the full address of the building - is available as open data and updated monthly.
        
        20 years of record make an impressive collection of house names and numbers.*****
        

    \subsubsection{{\it p1.2}: Statistically infer the existence of house numbers from the house numbers collected above.} 

        Each culture developed in time a convention for the assignment of house number and names to buildings. In the UK numbering was likely introduced in the early 18th Century as an alternative to house names. Buildings typically are numbered sequentially starting from 1, corresponding to the extremity of the road that is closest to the centre of the town the street is associated to. Odd numbers are on the left-hand side as seen from the centre, even number on the right-hand side. Intermediate properties usually have a number suffixed by one or more letters, this is typical of larger buildings that at some point in time got divided into more smaller dwellings. Modern buildings that have been named by their owner usually retain also a number, that was used by the local government authority during planning.
        
        Centuries of house development and using this system informally of course created many exceptions: e.g. there are buildings for whose house number is zero, places where numbers were assigned consecutively, and house numbers that are simply missing. Simple algorithms, though, have a very high probability to apply the numbering model described above to infer the existence of house numbers from other known house numbers. This is intuitive, as: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If we know that one even and one odd house numbers exist in a street, it is likely that all other numbers included within those numbers exist, too (e.g. we can infer 11 and 12 from the existence of 10 and 13)
            \item If we know that two even or odd house numbers exist in a street, it is likely that all other even or odd house numbers included within those numbers exist, too (e.g. we can infer 7 from the existence of 5 and 9, but not 6 and 8, as the right-hand side of the street may not have buildings)
            \item If we know that the same house number in a street is suffixed by two different letters, it is likely that all other letters included within those letters exist, too (e.g. we can infer 14B from the existence of 14A and 14C).
        \end{itemize}
        
        This simple inference is one of the simplest that can be implemented. Other available open data sources enable more complex algorithms, e.g. Ordnance Survey's "Open Maps - Local" [NEED TO CHECK] includes summary shapes for the buildings in each British street, hence enabling the detection of how many buildings are present and suggest how some house numbers may be missing.
        
    \subsubsection{{\it p1.3}: Enable the application of {\it p1.2} through surveying.} 

    \subsubsection{{\it p1.4}: Correct the output of {\it p1.2} through surveying.} 

\subsection{Task model}

    The following is a description of the approach that was used for crowdsourcing addresses, that is common to all experimental conditions that were tested.
    
    \textbf{Requester.} The Requester desires to validate the existence of a series of house numbers (e.g. "3" or "7A") in a specified street. Those were previously inferred algorithmically from the observation of \textit{existing} house numbers, as sourced from published open datasets\footnote{See the GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/Digital-Contraptions-Imaginarium/OLAF-yr2_reference_data} to learn about the reference open data we used, and the repository at \url{https://github.com/Digital-Contraptions-Imaginarium/OLAF-yr2_inference_data} for the inference algorithms.}. When the pictures in the survey tool are of insufficient quality to be read intelligibly (e.g. a house number could be "7A" but it is not clear) it is useful to the Requester to be informed of that. The Requester requires the help of human agents to carry out the tasks, that we will call Workers in the following.
    
    \textbf{Task.} Each HIT (Human Intelligence Task) consists of verifying the existence in a given street of a given specific tuple of inferred house numbers {[}SOME MATHS SYMBOLS HERE{]} that is a subset of the whole set of inferred house numbers for that street {[}SOME MATHS SYMBOLS HERE{]}. 
    
    \textbf{Strategy.} 
    {[}TO BE WRITTEN, DEPENDS ON THE EXPERIMENT SCENARIOS DEFINITION.{]}
    
    \textbf{Crowd $\rightarrow$ Worker.} Each Worker performs her task by declaring, for each house number in the given tuple and street, if a) it can be found by using the survey tool, b) it can't be found or c) it cannot be said with certainty (e.g. if some of the pictures are blurred and could correspond to the house number being searched). Multiple Workers are asked to validate the same tuple and the resulting data is chosen through majority voting.
    
    \textbf{Reliability.} When collecting data to build a dataset that is intended to be published under an open licence, the option to assess its \textit{quality} by comparison with other sources is often not available, for many reason. An alternative source of the same data could simply not be available. Moreover, from an intellectual property perspective, the comparison could make the former "derivative work" of the latter, hence compromising the purpose{[}SOME REFERENCE OR FOOTNOTE TO PUT MORE MEAT AROUND THIS POINT{]}. 
    
    What is possible, instead, is to estimate the \textit{reliability} of the crowdsourced data, independently of any actual knowledge of other sources and/or the ground truth. 
    
    In OLAF's case, the approach described is considered equivalent to what is used for crowdsourcing the acquisition of labels for data items when the labelling is imperfect, that is extensively covered in literature, e.g. in \cite{sheng2008get} or \cite{Welinder:2010vkb}{[STILL HAVE TO READ THE LATTER{]}. 
    
    The quality of the Workers' contribution could be measured by using gold standard tasks \cite{Oleson:2011tx}, e.g. asking them to validate sets of house numbers whose existence is already known. Because of the elementary complexity of the tasks, though, it was assumed that anything standing between the Worker and the actual required tasks would hinder their contribution in volume and quality and compromise furtherance.
    
    Lacking an assessment of the individual Worker's reliability, the option of preferring the best individual Workers vs using multiple labellers becomes unavailable, hence the need to use majority voting. 
    
    For simplicity, all Workers are considered equivalent from a reliability perspective, and the quality of their individual output assumed $ > 0.5 $, so that the \textit{uniform labeller quality} (see \cite{sheng2008get}) of the data chosen through majority voting increases as the number of labellers is increased.

    [NEEED TO SAY] Unlike other countries, in the UK local authorities do not provide house number plates to the building owners, so this remains their responsibility. Building owners have the option not to affix any plate at all.
