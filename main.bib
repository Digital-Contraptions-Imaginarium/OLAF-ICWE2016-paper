abstract = {The proliferation of information sources as a result of networked computers and other interconnected devices has prompted significant changes in the amount, availability, and nature of geographic information. Among the more significant changes is the increasing amount of readily available volunteered geographic information. Although volunteered information has fundamentally enhanced geographic data, it has also prompted concerns with regard to its quality, reliability, and overall value. This essay situates these concerns as issues of information and source credibility by (a) examining the information environment fostering collective information contribution, (b) exploring the environment of information abundance, examining credibility and related notions within this environment, and leveraging extant research findings to understand user-generated geographic information, (c) articulating strategies to discern the credibility of volunteered geographic information (VGI), including relevant tools useful in this endeavor, and (d) outlining specific research questions germane to VGI and credibility.},

journal = {First AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing},

abstract = {Computational approaches to health monitoring and epidemiology continue to evolve rapidly. We present an end-to-end system, nEmesis, that automatically identifies restaurants posing public health risks. Leveraging a language model of Twitter users' online communication, nEmesis finds individuals who are likely suffering from a foodborne illness. People's visits to restaurants are modeled by matching GPS data embedded in the messages with restaurant addresses. As a result, we can assign each venue a "health score" based on the proportion of customers that fell ill shortly after visiting it. Statistical analysis reveals that our inferred health score correlates ( r = 0.30) with the official inspection data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). We investigate the joint associations of multiple factors mined from online data with the DOHMH violation scores and find that over 23% of variance can be explained by our factors. We demonstrate that readily accessible online data can be used to detect cases of foodborne illness in a timely manner. This approach offers an inexpensive way to enhance current methods to monitor food safety (e.g., adaptive inspections) and identify potentially problematic venues in near-real time.},

We apply this framework in the domain of materials discovery, and demonstrate a speedup of over an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {With a large amount of tasks of various types, requesters in crowdsourcing platforms often bundle tasks of different types into a single working session. This creates a task switching setting, where workers need to shift between different cognitive tasks. We design and conduct an experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to study how occasionally presented performance-contingent monetary rewards, referred as monetary interventions , affect worker performance in the task switching setting. We use two competing metrics to evaluate worker performance. When monetary interventions are placed on some tasks in a working session, our results show that worker performance on these tasks can be improved in both metrics. Moreover, worker performance on other tasks where monetary interventions are not placed is also affected: workers perform better according to one metric, but worse according to the other metric. This suggests that in addition to providing extrinsic monetary incentives for some tasks, monetary interventions implicitly set performance goals for all tasks. Furthermore, monetary interventions are most effective in improving worker performance when used at switch tasks, tasks that follow a task of a different type, in working sessions with a low task switching frequency.},

abstract = {The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer training labels if it is allowed to choose the data from which it learns. An active learner may pose queries, usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easily obtained, but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain.
This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for successful active learning, a summary of problem setting variants and practical issues, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.},

Crowdsourcing information systems are socio-technical systems that provide informational products or services by harnessing the diverse potential of large groups of people via the Web. Interested individuals can contribute to such systems by selecting among a wide range of open tasks. Arguing that current approaches are suboptimal in terms of matching tasks and contributors' individual interests and capabilities, this article advocates the introduc- tion of personalized task recommendation mechanisms. We contribute to a conceptual foundation for the design of such mechanisms by conducting a systematic review of the corresponding academic literature. Based on the insights derived from this analysis, we identify a number of issues for future research. In particular, our findings highlight the need for more significant empirical results through large-scale online experiments, an improved dialog with mainstream recommender systems research, and the integration of various sources of knowledge that exceed the boundaries of individual systems.},

abstract = {In modern societies, cultural change seems ceaseless. The flux of fashion is especially obvious for popular music. While much has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of approximately~17 000 recordings that appeared in the charts and demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral properties. We then use these properties to produce an audio-based classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change. Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during three stylistic {\textquoteleft}revolutions{\textquoteright} around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a quantitative science of cultural change.},

abstract = {This paper studies a mechanism to incentivize agents who predict their own future actions and truthfully declare their predictions. In a crowdsouring setting (e.g., participatory sensing), obtaining an accurate prediction of the actions of workers/agents is valuable for a requester who is collecting real-world information from the crowd. If an agent predicts an external event that she cannot control herself (e.g., tomorrow's weather), any proper scoring rule can give an accurate incentive. In our problem setting, an agent needs to predict her own action (e.g., what time tomorrow she will take a photo of a specific place) that she can control to maximize her utility. Also, her (gross) utility can vary based on an eternal event. We first prove that a mechanism can satisfy our goal if and only if it utilizes a strictly proper scoring rule, assuming that an agent can find an optimal declaration that maximizes her expected utility. This declaration is self-fulfilling; if she acts to maximize her utility, the probabilistic distribution of her action matches her declaration, assuming her prediction about the external event is correct. Furthermore, we develop a heuristic algorithm that efficiently finds a semi-optimal declaration, and show that this declaration is still self-fulfilling. We also examine our heuristic algorithm's performance and describe how an agent acts when she faces an unexpected scenario.},

In reality, however, social cooperation can also arise spontaneously, based on local interactions rather than centralized control. The self-organization of cooperative behavior is particularly puzzling for social dilemmas related to sharing natural resources or creating common goods. Such situations are often described by the prisoner's dilemma. Here, we report the sudden outbreak of predominant cooperation in a noisy world dominated by selfishness and defection, when individuals imitate superior strategies and show success-driven migration. In our model, individuals are unrelated, and do not inherit behavioral traits. They defect or cooperate selfishly when the opportunity arises, and they do not know how often they will interact or have interacted with someone else. Moreover, our individuals have no reputation mechanism to form friendship networks, nor do they have the option of voluntary interaction or costly punishment. Therefore, the outbreak of prevailing cooperation, when directed motion is integrated in a game-theoretical model, is remarkable, particularly when random strategy mutations and random relocations challenge the formation and survival of cooperative clusters. Our results suggest that mobility is significant for the evolution of social order, and essential for its stabilization and maintenance.},

abstract = {Many crowdsourcing applications require spatial data modelling to make sense of location-based observations provided by multiple users. In this context, we propose a new spatial function modelling approach to address the problem of fusing multiple spatial observations reported by possibly untrustworthy users in the domains of participatory sensing and crowdsourcing applications. Specifically, we use a heteroskedastic Gaussian process model to incorporate user trust modelling into Bayesian spatial regression. In particular, by training the model with the reports gathered from the crowd, we are able to estimate the spatial function at any location of interest and also learn the level of trustworthiness of each user. We show that our method outperforms other standard homoskedastic and heteroskedastic Gaussian processes by up to 23% on a crowdsourced radiation dataset collected during the 2011 Fukushima earthquake in Japan. We also show that our method is able to improve the quality of spatial predictions on synthetic data by up to 70% and is robust in settings of up to 30% presence of untrustworthy users within the crowd.},

abstract = {The emergence of online crowdsourcing sites, online work platforms, and evenMassive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), has created an increasing need for reliably evaluating the skills of the participating users in a scalable way.Many platforms already allow users to take online tests and verify their skills, but the existing approaches face many problems. First of all, cheating is very common in online testing without supervision, as the test questions often "leak" and become easily available online together with the answers.Second, technical skills, such as programming, require the tests to be frequently updated in order to reflect the current state-of-the-art. Third,there is very limited evaluation of the tests themselves, and how effectively they measure the skill that the users are tested for. In this paper, we present a Scalable Testing and Evaluation Platform (STEP),that allows continuous generation and evaluation of test questions. STEP leverages already available content, on Question Answering sites such as StackOverflow and re-purposes these questions to generate tests. The system utilizes a crowdsourcing component for the editing of the questions, while it uses automated techniques for identifying promising QA threads that can be successfully re-purposed for testing. This continuous question generation decreases the impact of cheating and also creates questions that are closer to the real problems that the skill holder is expected to solve in real life.STEP also leverages the use of Item Response Theory to evaluate the quality of the questions. We also use external signals about the quality of the workers.These identify the questions that have the strongest predictive ability in distinguishing workers that have the potential to succeed in the online job marketplaces. Existing approaches contrast in using only internal consistency metrics to evaluate the questions. Finally, our system employs an automatic "leakage detector" that queries the Internet to identify leaked versions of our questions. We then mark these questions as "practice only," effectively removing them from the pool of questions used for evaluation. Our experimental evaluation shows that our system generates questions of comparable or higher quality compared to existing tests, with a cost of approximately 3-5 dollars per question, which is lower than the cost of licensing questions from existing test banks.},

Common tasks on the system include labelling a collection of images, com- bining two sets of images to identify people which appear in both, or extracting sentiment from a corpus of text snippets. Designing a workflow of various kinds of HITs for filtering, aggregating, sorting, and joining data sources together is common, and comes with a set of challenges in optimizing the cost per HIT, the overall time to task completion, and the accuracy of MTurk results. We propose Qurk, a novel query system for managing these workflows, allowing crowd- powered processing of relational databases. We describe a number of query execution and optimization challenges, and discuss some potential solutions.},

While CASCADE needs only unskilled labor and produces taxonomies whose quality approaches that of human experts, it uses significantly more labor than experts. This paper presents DELUGE, an improved workflow that produces taxonomies with comparable quality using significantly less crowd labor. Specifically, our method for crowdsourcing multi-label classification optimizes CASCADE{\textquoteright}s most costly step (categorization) using less than 10% of the labor required by the original approach. DELUGE{\textquoteright}s savings come from the use of decision theory and machine learning, which allow it to pose microtasks that aim to maximize information gain.},

abstract = {One of the most popular uses of crowdsourcing is to provide training data for supervised machine learning algorithms. Since human annotators often make errors, requesters commonly ask multiple workers to label each example. ~But is this strategy always the most cost effective use of crowdsourced workers? We argue "No" --- often classifiers can achieve higher accuracies when trained with noisy "unilabeled" data. However, in some cases relabeling is extremely important. ~We discuss three factors that may make relabeling an effective strategy: classifier expressiveness, worker accuracy, and budget.},

abstract = {Social collaboration has been shown to facilitate problemsolving activity in diverse sets of environments. Nevertheless, if not well designed, social and human computation systems may achieve results only similar to those of a single human subject performing a task. This scenario reflects a need for better understanding of the performance issues of human problem-solving social networks. Firstly, we propose a model for simulating social problem-solving. We then carry out several simulations with artificial agents supported by results of experiments carried out with human subjects, in order to analyse which parameters influence the performance of collaborative problem-solving social networks. We analyse the strategies humans follow when solving a problem, comparing them with alternative ones, and identify the consequences of the employed strategies in the collective performance of the social network. Our results also indicate that copying and guessing are beneficial to the performance of the social networks. We then propose mechanisms that can improve collaborative problem-solving. Finally, we show that our results lead to a methodology for the design of efficient problem-solving systems that can be applied to several kinds of collaborative social systems.},

abstract = {Agents are asked to rank two objects in a setting where effort is costly and agents differ in quality (which is the probability that they can identify the correct, ground truth, ranking). We study simple output-agreement mechanisms that pay an agent in the case she agrees with the report of another, and potentially penalizes for disagreement through a negative payment. Assuming access to a quality oracle, able to determine whether an agent's quality is above a given threshold, we design a payment scheme that aligns incentives so that agents whose quality is above this threshold participate and invest effort. Precluding negative payments leads the expected cost of this quality-oracle mechanism to increase by a factor of 2 to 5 relative to allowing both positive and negative payments. Dropping the assumption about access to a quality oracle, we further show that negative payments can be used to make agents with quality lower than the quality threshold choose to not to participate, while those above continue to participate and invest effort. Through the appropriate choice of payments, any design threshold can be achieved. This self-selection mechanism has the same expected cost as the cost-minimal quality-oracle mechanism, and thus when using the self-selection mechanism, perfect screening comes for free.},

abstract = {Humorous images can be seen in many social media websites. However, newcomers to these websites often have trouble fitting in because the community subculture is usually implicit. Among all the types of humorous images, Internet memes are relatively hard for newcomers to understand. In this work, we develop a system that leverages crowdsourcing techniques to generate explanations for memes. We claim that people who are not familiar with Internet meme subculture can still quickly pick up the gist of the memes by reading the explanations. Our template-based explanations illustrate the incongruity between normal situations and the punchlines in jokes. The explanations can be produced by completing the two proposed human task processes. Experimental results suggest that the explanations produced by our system greatly help newcomers to understand unfamiliar memes. For further research, it is possible to employ our explanation generation system to improve computational humanities.},

If a worker is unable to solve a given task it must be forwarded to a worker of greater ability. For a given set of worker abilities W and a distribution P over task difficulty, we are interested in the problem of designing efficient forwarding structures for W and P. We give efficient algorithms and structures that simultaneously (approximately) minimize both the maximum workload of any worker, and the number of workers that need to attempt a task. We identify broad conditions under which workloads diminish rapidly with the workforce size, yet only a constant number of workers attempt each task.},

Yet, reasonable privacy concerns often limit the access to such data streams. How should systems valuate and negotiate access to private information, for example in return for monetary incentives? How should they optimally choose the participants from a large population of strategic users with privacy concerns, and compensate them for information shared? In this paper, we address these questions and present a novel mechanism, SeqTGreedy, for budgeted recruitment of participants in community sensing. We first show that privacy tradeoffs in community sensing can be cast as an adaptive submodular optimization problem. We then design a budget feasible, incentive compatible (truthful) mechanism for adaptive submodular maximization, which achieves near-optimal utility for a large class of sensing applications. This mechanism is general, and of independent interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study of air quality monitoring, using data collected from the Mechanical Turk platform. Compared to the state of the art, our approach achieves up to 30% reduction in cost in order to achieve a desired level of utility.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of a crowdsourcing application and controlling the quality of the data it generates is challenging, partly due to the lack of tools to do so. Provenance is a domain-independent means to represent what happened in an application, which can help verify data and infer their quality. It can also reveal the processes that led to a data item and the interactions of contributors with it. Provenance patterns can manifest real-world phenomena such as a significant interest in a piece of content, providing an indication of its quality, or even issues such as undesirable interactions within a group of contributors. This paper presents an application-independent methodology for analyzing provenance graphs, constructed from provenance records, to learn about such patterns and to use them for assessing some key properties of crowdsourced data, such as their quality, in an automated manner. Validating this method on the provenance records of CollabMap, an online crowdsourcing mapping application, we demonstrated an accuracy level of over 95% for the trust classification of data generated by the crowd therein.},

abstract = {Early in this century, most empirically oriented psychologists believed that all motivation was based in the physiology of a set of non-nervous system tissue needs. The theories of that era reflected this belief and used it in an attempt to explain an increasing number of phenomena. It was not until the 1950s that it became irrefutably clear that much of human motivation is based not in these drives, but rather in a set of innate psychological needs. Their physiological basis is less understood; and as concepts, these needs lend themselves more easily to psycho logical than to physiological theorizing. The convergence of evidence from a variety of scholarly efforts suggests that there are three such needs: self-determination, competence, and interpersonal relatedness. This book is primarily about self-determination and competence (with particular emphasis on the former), and about the processes and structures that relate to these needs. The need for interpersonal relat edness, while no less important, remains to be explored, and the findings from those explorations will need to be integrated with the present theory to develop a broad, organismic theory of human motivation. Thus far, we have articulated self-determination theory, which is offered as a working theory-a theory in the making. To stimulate the research that will allow it to evolve further, we have stated self-determination theory in the form of minitheories that relate to more circumscribed domains, and we have developed paradigms for testing predictions from the various minitheories.},

We observe that performance by unpaid and paid workers can be compared in carefully designed tasks, that financial incentives can be used to trade quality for speed, and that the compensation system on Amazon Mechanical Turk creates particular indirect incentives for workers. Our methodology and results have implications for the ideal choice of financial incentives and motivates further study on how monetary incentives influence worker behavior in crowdsourcing.},

abstract = {Constructing a good conference schedule for a large multi-track conference needs to take into account the preferences and constraints of organizers, authors, and attendees. Creating a schedule which has fewer conflicts for authors and attendees, and thematically coherent sessions is a challenging task. Cobi introduced an alternative approach to conference scheduling by engaging the community to play an active role in the planning process. The current Cobi pipeline consists of committee-sourcing and author-sourcing to plan a conference schedule. We further explore the design space of community-sourcing by introducing attendee-sourcing -- a process that collects input from conference attendees and encodes them as preferences and constraints for creating sessions and schedule. For CHI 2014, a large multi-track conference in human-computer interaction with more than 3,000 attendees and 1,000 authors, we collected attendees{\textquoteright} preferences by making available all the accepted papers at the conference on a paper recommendation tool we built called Confer, for a period of 45 days before announcing the conference program (sessions and schedule). We compare the preferences marked on Confer with the preferences collected from Cobi{\textquoteright}s author-sourcing approach. We show that attendee-sourcing can provide insights beyond what can be discovered by author-sourcing. For CHI 2014, the results show value in the method and attendees{\textquoteright} participation. It produces data that provides more alternatives in scheduling and complements data collected from other methods for creating coherent sessions and reducing conflicts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Writing plays a central role in the communication of scientific ideas and is therefore a key aspect in researcher education, ultimately determining the success and long-term sustainability of their careers. Despite the growing popularity of e-learning, we are not aware of any existing study comparing on-line vs. traditional classroom-based methods for teaching scientific writing.

METHODS:Forty eight participants from a medical, nursing and physiotherapy background from US and Brazil were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 24 per group): An on-line writing workshop group (on-line group), in which participants used virtual communication, google docs and standard writing templates, and a standard writing guidance training (standard group) where participants received standard instruction without the aid of virtual communication and writing templates. Two outcomes, manuscript quality was assessed using the scores obtained in Six subgroup analysis scale as the primary outcome measure, and satisfaction scores with Likert scale were evaluated. To control for observer variability, inter-observer reliability was assessed using Fleiss's kappa. A post-hoc analysis comparing rates of communication between mentors and participants was performed. Nonparametric tests were used to assess intervention efficacy.

RESULTS:Excellent inter-observer reliability among three reviewers was found, with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) agreement = 0.931882 and ICC consistency = 0.932485. On-line group had better overall manuscript quality (p = 0.0017, SSQSavg score 75.3 +/- 14.21, ranging from 37 to 94) compared to the standard group (47.27 +/- 14.64, ranging from 20 to 72). Participant satisfaction was higher in the on-line group (4.3 +/- 0.73) compared to the standard group (3.09 +/- 1.11) (p = 0.001). The standard group also had fewer communication events compared to the on-line group (0.91 +/- 0.81 vs. 2.05 +/- 1.23; p = 0.0219).

CONCLUSION:Our protocol for on-line scientific writing instruction is better than standard face-to-face instruction in terms of writing quality and student satisfaction. Future studies should evaluate the protocol efficacy in larger longitudinal cohorts involving participants from different languages.},

We present a method for estimating the underlying value (e.g. the class) of each image from (noisy) an- notations provided by multiple annotators. Our method is based on a model of the image formation and annotation process. Each image has different characteristics that are represented in an abstract Euclidean space. Each annotator is modeled as a multidimensional entity with variables representing competence, expertise and bias. This allows the model to discover and represent groups of annotators that have different sets of skills and knowledge, as well as groups of images that differ qualitatively. We find that our model predicts ground truth labels on both syn- thetic and real data more accurately than state of the art methods. Experiments also show that our model, starting from a set of binary labels, may discover rich information, such as different {\textquotedblleft}schools of thought{\textquotedblright} amongst the annotators, and can group together images belonging to separate categories.},

abstract = {In social choice theory, preference aggregation refers to computing an aggregate preference over a set of alternatives given individual preferences of all the agents. In real-world scenarios, it may not be feasible to gather preferences from all the agents. Moreover, determining the aggregate preference is computationally intensive. In this paper, we show that the aggregate preference of the agents in a social network can be computed efficiently and with sufficient accuracy using preferences elicited from a small subset of critical nodes in the network. Our methodology uses a model developed based on real-world data obtained using a survey on human subjects, and exploits network structure and homophily of relationships. Our approach guarantees good performance for aggregation rules that satisfy a property which we call expected weak insensitivity. We demonstrate empirically that many practically relevant aggregation rules satisfy this property. We also show that two natural objective functions in this context satisfy certain properties, which makes our methodology attractive for scalable preference aggregation over large scale social networks. We conclude that our approach is superior to random polling while aggregating preferences related to individualistic metrics, whereas random polling is acceptable in the case of social metrics.},

abstract = {Within the academic and popular discussion of neogeography, it is routinely argued that the process of producing and using geographical information has been fundamentally democratised. Neogeography, in contrast to {\textquoteleft}established geography{\textquoteright}, especially uses the argument that it is for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Similar arguments have been used to praise the growth in Web GIS since the mid-1990s and seem to be persistent in the conceptualisation of these technologies. However, what is the nature of this democracy, and to what extent do the technologies that are used in neogeography fulfil this democratisation promise? In this contribution the framework offered by Andrew Feenberg in his critical theory of technology, and especially his call for {\textquoteleft}deep democratisation{\textquoteright}, is used to provide a critique of these assertions of the nature of neogeography. The analysis shows that, unlike early critical GIS and the literature on participatory GIS, the analysis of neogeography adopted an instrumentalist interpretation of the technology and its applications. This view claims that technology is value free and that there is a separation between means and ends. This type of argument ignores and disguises the values that are integrated inexorably in advanced technologies. Once the values are exposed and discussed, neogeography becomes far less exciting and transformative. It becomes clear that there is a separation between a technological elite and a wider group of uninformed, labouring participants who are not empowered through the use of the technology. There are also multiple obstacles that limit the democratic potential of neogeography. The analysis progresses by considering the hierarchy of hacking, understood here as the ability to alter and change the meaning and use of a specific technological system. This hierarchy further explains the democratisation potentialities and limits of neogeography. Because of the reduced barriers, neogeography does offer some increased level of democratisation but, to fulfil this potential, it requires careful implementation that takes into account social and political aspects.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of large-scale mobile crowd-tasking, where a large pool of citizen crowd-workers are used to perform a variety of location-specific urban logistics tasks. Current approaches to such mobile crowd-tasking are very decentralized: a crowd-tasking platform usually provides each worker a set of available tasks close to the worker's current location; each worker then independently chooses which tasks she wants to accept and perform. In contrast, we propose TRACCS, a more coordinated task assignment approach, where the crowd-tasking platform assigns a sequence of tasks to each worker, taking into account their expected location trajectory over a wider time horizon, as opposed to just instantaneous location. We formulate such task assignment as an optimization problem, that seeks to maximize the total payoff from all assigned tasks, subject to a maximum bound on the detour (from the expected path) that a worker will experience to complete her assigned tasks. We develop credible computationally-efficient heuristics to address this optimization problem (whose exact solution requires solving a complex integer linear program), and show, via simulations with realistic topologies and commuting patterns, that a specific heuristic (called Greedy-ILS) increases the fraction of assigned tasks by more than 20%, and reduces the average detour overhead by more than 60%, compared to the current decentralized approach.},

The current approach for measuring question difficulty in MCQs relies on models of how good pupils will perform and contrasts that with their lower- performing peers. MCQs can be difficult in many ways. This paper looks specifically at the effect of both the num- ber of words in the question stem and in the answer options on question difficulty. This work is based on the hypothesis that questions are more difficult if the stem of the question and the answer options are semantically far apart. This hy- pothesis can be normalized, in part, with an analysis of the length of texts being compared. The MCQs used in the ex- periments were voluntarily authored by university students in biology courses. Future work includes additional experi- ments utilizing other aspects of this extensive crowdsourced data set.},

But an alternative goal{\textemdash}one that is especially relevant for research in the domains of language meaning and use{\textemdash} is to tap into people{\textquoteright}s rich experience as everyday users of language. Research in these areas has the poten- tial to tell us a great deal about how language works, but designing annotation frameworks for crowdsourc- ing of this kind poses special challenges. In this paper we define and exemplify two approaches to linguistic data collection corresponding to these differing goals (model-driven and user-driven) and discuss some hy- brid cases in which they overlap. We also describe some design principles and resolution techniques helpful for eliciting linguistic wisdom from the crowd.},

While automatic IE systems have proven useful in controlled experiments, in practice the gap between machine learning extraction and human extraction is still quite large. In this paper, we propose a system that uses crowdsourcing techniques to help close this gap. One of the fundamental issues inherent in using a large-scale human workforce is deciding the optimal questions to pose to the crowd. We demonstrate novel solutions using mutual information and token clustering techniques in the domain of bibliographic citation extraction. Our experiments show promising results in using crowd assistance as a cost-effective way to close up the {\textquotedblright}last mile{\textquotedblright} between extraction systems and a human annotator.},

This work focuses on the scenario where the explicit feature representation of items is unavailable, a setup that is similar to collaborative filtering. In order to learn a user's preferences from his/her response to only a small number of pairwise comparisons, we propose to leverage the pairwise comparisons made by many crowd users, a problem we refer to as crowdranking. The proposed crowdranking framework is based on the theory of matrix completion, and we present efficient algorithms for solving the related optimization problem. Our theoretical analysis shows that, on average, only O ( r log m ) pairwise queries are needed to accurately recover the ranking list of m items for the target user, where r is the rank of the unknown rating matrix, r {\&}lt;{\&}lt; m . Our empirical study with two real-world benchmark datasets for collaborative filtering and one crowdranking dataset we collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk shows the promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

In sharp contrast to existing data management approaches, where human input is either ad-hoc or is never used, we describe the design of the first declarative language involving human-computable functions, standard relational operators, as well as algorithmic computation. We consider the challenges involved in optimizing queries posed in this language, in particular, the tradeoffs between uncertainty, cost and performance, as well as combination of human and algorithmic evidence. We believe that the vision laid out in this paper can act as a road-map for a new area of data management research where human computation is routinely used in data analytics.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of large-scale mobile crowd-tasking, where a large pool of citizen crowd-workers are used to perform a variety of location-specific urban logistics tasks. Current approaches to such mobile crowd-tasking are very decentralized: a crowd-tasking platform usually provides each worker a set of available tasks close to the worker's current location; each worker then independently chooses which tasks she wants to accept and perform. In contrast, we propose TRACCS, a more coordinated task assignment approach, where the crowd-tasking platform assigns a sequence of tasks to each worker, taking into account their expected location trajectory over a wider time horizon, as opposed to just instantaneous location. We formulate such task assignment as an optimization problem, that seeks to maximize the total payoff from all assigned tasks, subject to a maximum bound on the detour (from the expected path) that a worker will experience to complete her assigned tasks. We develop credible computationally-efficient heuristics to address this optimization problem (whose exact solution requires solving a complex integer linear program), and show, via simulations with realistic topologies and commuting patterns, that a specific heuristic (called Greedy-ILS) increases the fraction of assigned tasks by more than 20%, and reduces the average detour overhead by more than 60%, compared to the current decentralized approach.},

abstract = {A popular use of crowdsourcing is to collect and aggregate individual worker responses to problems to reach a correct answer. This paper studies the relationship between the computation complexity class of problems, and the ability of a group to agree on a correct solution. We hypothesized that for NP-Complete (NPC) problems, groups would be able to reach a majority-based correct solution once it was suggested by a group member and presented to the other members, due to the "easy to verify" (i.e., verification in polynomial time) characteristic of this complexity class. In contrast, when posed with PSPACE-Complete (PSC) ~"hard to verify" problems (i.e., verification in exponential time), groups will not necessarily be able to choose a correct solution even if such a solution has been presented. Consequently, increasing the size of the group is expected to facilitate the ability of the group to converge on a correct solution when solving NPC problems, but not when solving PSC problems. To test this hypothesis we conducted preliminary experiments in which we evaluated people's ability to solve an analytical problem and their ability to recognize a correct solution. In our experiments, participants were significantly more likely to recognize correct and incorrect solutions for NPC problems than for PSC problems, even for problems of similar difficulties (as measured by the percentage of participants who solved the problem). This is a first step towards formalizing a relationship between the computationally complexity of a problem and the crowd's ability to converge to a correct solution to the problem.},

To make such comparative evaluation easier for everyone, we present SQUARE, an open source shared task framework including benchmark datasets, defined tasks, standard metrics, and reference implementations with empirical results for several popular methods. In addition to measuring performance on a variety of public, real crowd datasets, the benchmark also varies supervision and noise by manipulating training size and labeling error. We envision SQUARE as dynamic and continually evolving, with new datasets and reference implementations being added according to community needs and interest. We invite community contributions and participation.},

abstract = {Some queries cannot be answered by machines only. Processing such queries requires human input for providing information that is missing from the database, for performing computationally difficult functions, and for matching, ranking, or aggregating results based on fuzzy criteria. CrowdDB uses human input via crowdsourcing to process queries that neither database systems nor search engines can adequately answer. It uses SQL both as a language for pos- ing complex queries and as a way to model data. While CrowdDB leverages many aspects of traditional database systems, there are also important differences. Conceptually, a major change is that the traditional closed-world assumption for query processing does not hold for human input. From an implementation perspective, human-oriented query operators are needed to solicit, integrate and cleanse crowdsourced data. Furthermore, performance and cost de- pend on a number of new factors including worker affinity, train- ing, fatigue, motivation and location. We describe the design of CrowdDB, report on an initial set of experiments using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and outline important avenues for future work in the development of crowdsourced query processing systems.},

abstract = {We present theoretical and empirical results demonstrating the usefulness of social choice functions in crowdsourcing for participatory democracies. First, we demonstrate the scalability of social choice functions by defining a natural notion of epsilon-approximation, and giving algorithms which efficiently elicit such approximations for two prominent social choice functions: the Borda rule and the Condorcet winner. This result circumvents previous prohibitive lower bounds and is surprisingly strong: even if the number of ideas is as large as the number of participants, each participant will only have to make a logarithmic number of comparisons, an exponential improvement over the linear number of comparisons previously needed. Second, we apply these ideas to Finland's recent off-road traffic law reform, an experiment on participatory democracy in real life. This allows us to verify the scaling predicted in our theory and show that the constant involved is also not large. In addition, by collecting data on the time that users take to complete rankings of varying sizes, we observe that eliciting partial rankings can further decrease elicitation time as compared to the common method of eliciting pairwise comparisons.},

Other forms of crowdsourc- ing have however, embraced a mixed model that further al- lows for interaction and collaboration between participants. Our paper studies the feasibility and uptake of such an ap- proach in the context of paid microtasks by comparing en- gagement, task output, and task accuracy in this model with the traditional, single-worker version. Our results show that collaboration leads to better accuracy and more output, trans- lating into lower costs. We also explore the role of social flow and social pressure generated by collaborating partners, as sources of incentives for improved output. Our experiments reveal that these socially motivated incentives can act as fur- therance mechanisms to help workers attain and exceed their task requirements, produce even better results than baseline collaborations, and yield more accurate outputs.},

To better model such temporal worker behavior, we propose a time-series label prediction model for crowd work. This latent variable model captures and summarizes past worker behavior, enabling us to better predict the quality of each worker's next label. Given inherent uncertainty in prediction, we also investigate a decision reject option to balance the tradeoff between prediction accuracy vs. coverage. Results show our model improves accuracy of both label prediction on real crowd worker data, as well as data quality overall.},

abstract = {Similarity comparisons of the form "Is object a more similar to b than to c?" form a useful foundation in several computer vision and machine learning applications. Unfortunately, an embedding of n points is only uniquely specified by n 3 triplets, making collecting every triplet an expensive task. In noticing this difficulty, other researchers investigated more intelligent triplet sampling techniques, but they do not study their effectiveness or their potential drawbacks. Although it is important to reduce the number of collected triplets to generate a good embedding, it is also important to understand how best to display a triplet collection task to the user to better respect the worker's human constraints. In this work, we explore an alternative method for collecting triplets and analyze its financial cost, collection speed, and worker happiness as a function of the final embedding quality. We propose best practices for creating cost effective human intelligence tasks for collecting triplets. We show that rather than changing the sampling algorithm, simple changes to the crowdsourcing UI can drastically decrease the cost of collecting similarity comparisons. Finally, we provide a food similarity dataset as well as the labels collected from crowd workers.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of large-scale mobile crowd-tasking, where a large pool of citizen crowd-workers are used to perform a variety of location-specific urban logistics tasks. Current approaches to such mobile crowd-tasking are very decentralized: a crowd-tasking platform usually provides each worker a set of available tasks close to the worker's current location; each worker then independently chooses which tasks she wants to accept and perform. In contrast, we propose TRACCS, a more coordinated task assignment approach, where the crowd-tasking platform assigns a sequence of tasks to each worker, taking into account their expected location trajectory over a wider time horizon, as opposed to just instantaneous location. We formulate such task assignment as an optimization problem, that seeks to maximize the total payoff from all assigned tasks, subject to a maximum bound on the detour (from the expected path) that a worker will experience to complete her assigned tasks. We develop credible computationally-efficient heuristics to address this optimization problem (whose exact solution requires solving a complex integer linear program), and show, via simulations with realistic topologies and commuting patterns, that a specific heuristic (called Greedy-ILS) increases the fraction of assigned tasks by more than 20%, and reduces the average detour overhead by more than 60%, compared to the current decentralized approach.},

abstract = {We created a spatial location identification task (SpLIT) in which workers recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk were presented with a camera view of a location, and were asked to identify the location on a two-dimensional map. In cases where these cues were ambiguous or did not provide enough information to pinpoint the exact location, workers had to make a best guess. We tested the effects of two reward schemes. In the {\textquotedblleft}ground truth{\textquotedblright} scheme, workers were rewarded if their answers were close enough to the correct locations. In the {\textquotedblleft}majority vote{\textquotedblright} scheme, workers were told that they would be rewarded if their answers were similar to the majority of other workers. Results showed that the majority vote reward scheme led to consistently more accurate answers. Cluster analysis further showed that the majority vote reward scheme led to answers with higher reliability (a higher percentage of answers in the correct clusters) and precision (a smaller average distance to the cluster centers). Possible reasons for why the majority voting reward scheme was better were discussed.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing and citizen science have established themselves in the mainstream of research methodology in recent years, employing a variety of methods to solve problems using human computation. An approach described here, termed "groupsourcing", uses social networks to present problems and collect solutions. This paper details a method for archiving social network messages and investigates messages containing an image classification task in the domain of marine biology. In comparison to other methods, groupsourcing offers a high accuracy, data-driven and low cost approach.},

Supervised classification needs large amounts of annotated training data that is expensive to create. Two approaches that reduce the cost of annotation are active learning and crowd- sourcing. However, these two approaches have not been combined successfully to date. We evaluate the utility of active learning in crowdsourcing on two tasks, named entity recognition and sentiment detection, and show that active learning outperforms random selec- tion of annotation examples in a noisy crowd- sourcing scenario.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a technique to outsource tasks to a number of workers. Although crowdsourcing has many advantages, it gives rise to the risk that sensitive information may be leaked, which has limited the spread of its popularity. Task instances (data workers receive to process tasks) often contain sensitive information, which can be extracted by workers. For example, in an audio transcription task, an audio file corresponds to an instance, and the content of the audio (e.g., the abstract of a meeting) can be sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a quantitative analysis framework for the instance privacy problem. The proposed framework supplies us performance measures of instance privacy preserving protocols. As a case study, we apply the proposed framework to an instance clipping protocol and analyze the properties of the protocol. The protocol preserves privacy by clipping instances to limit the amount of information workers obtain. The results show that the protocol can balance task performance and instance privacy preservation. They also show that the proposed measure is consistent with standard measures, which validates the proposed measure.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing struggles when workers must see all of the pieces of input to make an accurate judgment. For example, to find the most important scenes in a novel or movie, each worker must spend hours consuming the entire plot to acquire a global understanding and then apply that understanding to each local scene. To enable the crowdsourcing of large-scale goals with only local views, we introduce context trees, a crowdsourcing workflow for creating global summaries of a large input. Context trees recursively combine elements through written summaries to form a tree. Workers can then ground their local decisions by applying those summaries back down to the leaf nodes. In the case of scale ratings such as scene importance, we introduce a weighting process that percolates ratings downwards through the tree so that important nodes in unimportant branches are not overweighted. When using context trees to rate the importance of scenes in a 4000-word story and a 100-minute movie, workers{\textquoteright} ratings are nearly as accurate as those who saw the entire input, and much improved over the traditional approach of splitting the input into independent segments. To explore whether context trees enable crowdsourcing to undertake new classes of goals, we also crowdsource the solution to a large hierarchical puzzle of 462,000 interlocking pieces.},

Posted questions can be multiple sentences long and span diverse domains. They go beyond factoid questions and can be conversational, opinion-seeking and experiential questions, that might have multiple, potentially conflicting, useful answers from different users. In this paper, we describe a large-scale formative study to collect commonsense properties of questions and answers from 18 diverse communities from stack- exchange.com. We collected 50,000 human judgments on 500 question-answer pairs. Commonsense proper- ties are features that humans can extract and character- ize reliably by using their commonsense knowledge and native language skills, and no special domain expertise is assumed. We report results and suggestions for de- signing human computation tasks for collecting com- monsense semantic judgments.},

abstract = {The idea of building a spatial data set by integrating data chunks collected by a large group of 
voluntary contributors is gaining momentum. Well-known examples are the trail libraries that 
mountain bikers and other sports enthusiasts have created recently. With Web 2.0 technologies 
supporting the self-organization of large user communities, the recruitment of contributors seems the 
least problem of the approach. Much more serious is the issue of data aggregation which can threaten 
the feasibility of collaborative acquisition of spatial data. Solutions have been proposed to the purely 
spatial part of the problem (e.g. the aggregation of GPS-tracks) while the semantic part, that is, the 
integration of conflicting thematic data, has received much less attention so far. We present an 
approach that uses Semantic Web technologies {\textendash} formal ontologies {\textendash} to describe spatial and semantic 
aggregation methods. More specifically, we present a rule-based language that allows us to express 
spatial and semantic preconditions for the application of aggregation methods. With a worked 
example we illustrate which type of problems our approach is able to resolve.

abstract = {Crowd-sourcing is increasingly being used for providing responses to polls and surveys on a large scale. Companies such as SurveyMonkey and Instant.ly are attempting to make crowd-sourced surveys commonplace, by making it easy to pose survey questions using an easy-to-use UI and retrieve results with a relatively low latency by having dedicated crowds at their disposal. In this paper we argue that the ease with which polls can be created conceals an inherent difficulty: the survey maker does not know how many workers to hire for their survey. Asking too few may lead to samples sizes that `"do not look impressive enough." Asking too many clearly involves spending extra money, which can quickly become costly. Existing crowd-sourcing platforms do not provide help with this, neither, one can argue, do they have any incentive to do so. We present a systematic approach to determining how many samples (i.e. workers) are required to achieve a certain level of statistical significance by showing how to automatically perform power analysis on questions of interest. Using a range of queries we demonstrate that power analysis can save significant amounts of money and time by concluding that frequently, only a handful of results is required to arrive at a certain decision. We have implemented our approach within InterPoll, aprogrammable developer-driven polling system that uses a generic crowd (Mechanical Turk) as a back-end. Power analysis is automatically performed given both the structure of the query and the data that is being polled from the crowd. In all of our studies we are able to obtain statistically significant answers for under $30, with most costing less than $10. Our approach saves both time and money for the survey maker.},

By quantitatively analyzing a large number of contests, we report on the dynamics of the interactions between contests and designers. We show results on the effects of different financial incentives and contests' properties on the number and quality of submissions, as well as on how rewards are distributed across designers. We find that higher financial incentives do not translate to more effort by individual designers, but nonetheless have an impact on the quality outcome of contests by attracting a larger pool of designers. We also show that a majority of contests are dominated by a disproportionate few designers, which are both more active and effective in the service.},

We address the problem of identifying tasks that are rewarding to the citizen scientists, which results in greater participation, leading to more data and better models. We apply our methodology to eBird, whose participants are avid birders interested in observing different species while contributing to science. In order to improve the birders' chances of meeting their goals, we consider the following probabilistic maximum coverage problem: Given a set of locations, select a subset of size k, such that the birders maximize the expected number of observed species by visiting such locations. We also consider a secondary objective that gives preference to birding sites not previously visited. We consider two variants of the probabilistic maximum coverage problem, provide a theoretical analysis, describe several algorithms with provable approximation guarantees, as well as heuristic approaches, and provide empirical results using eBird data. Our algorithms are fast and provide high quality recommendations.},

abstract = {We present a research roadmap of a Planetary Nervous System (PNS), capable of sensing and mining the digital breadcrumbs of human activities and unveiling the knowledge hidden in the big data for addressing the big questions about social complexity. We envision the PNS as a globally distributed, self-organizing, techno-social system for answering analytical questions about the status of world-wide soci- ety, based on three pillars: social sensing, social mining and the idea of trust networks and privacy-aware social mining. We discuss the ingre- dients of a science and a technology necessary to build the PNS upon the three mentioned pillars, beyond the limitations of their respective state-of-art. Social sensing is aimed at developing better methods for harvesting the big data from the techno-social ecosystem and make them available for mining, learning and analysis at a properly high ab- straction level. Social mining is the problem of discovering patterns and models of human behaviour from the sensed data across the various so- cial dimensions by data mining, machine learning and social network analysis. Trusted networks and privacy-aware social mining is aimed at creating a new deal around the questions of privacy and data own- ership empowering individual persons with full awareness and control on own personal data, so that users may allow access and use of their data for their own good and the common good. The PNS will provide a goal-oriented knowledge discovery framework, made of technology and people, able to configure itself to the aim of answering questions about the pulse of global society. Given an analytical request, the PNS activates a process composed by a variety of interconnected tasks ex- ploiting the social sensing and mining methods within the transparent ecosystem provided by the trusted network. The PNS we foresee is the key tool for individual and collective awareness for the knowledge so- ciety. We need such a tool for everyone to become fully aware of how powerful is the knowledge of our society we can achieve by leveraging our wisdom as a crowd, and how important is that everybody partic- ipates both as a consumer and as a producer of the social knowledge, for it to become a trustable, accessible, safe and useful public good.},

abstract = {The ability to entice and engage crowd workers to participate in human intelligence tasks (HITs) is critical for many human computation systems and large-scale experiments. While various metrics have been devised to measure and improve the quality of worker output via task designs, effective recruitment of crowd workers is often overlooked. To help us gain a better understanding of crowd recruitment strategies we propose three new metrics for measuring crowd workers' willingness to participate in advertised HITs: conversion rate, conversion rate over time, and nominal conversion rate. We discuss how the conversion rate of workers{\textemdash}the number of potential workers aware of a task that choose to accept the task{\textemdash}can affect the quantity, quality, and validity of any data collected via crowdsourcing. We also contribute a tool {\textemdash} turkmill {\textemdash} that enables requesters on Amazon Mechanical Turk to easily measure the conversion rate of HITs. We then present the results of two experiments that demonstrate how conversion rate metrics can be used to evaluate the effect of different HIT designs. We investigate how four HIT design features (value proposition, branding, quality of presentation, and intrinsic motivation) affect conversion rates. Among other things, we find that including a clear value proposition has a strong significant, positive effect on the nominal conversion rate. We also find that crowd workers prefer commercial entities to non-profit or university requesters.},

The approach relies on a comparison with a representation of higher accuracy, and estimates the percentage of the total length of the low accuracy representation that is within a specified distance of the high accuracy representation. The approach deals successfully with three deficiencies of other methods: it is statistically based; is relatively insensitive to extreme outliers; and does not require matching of points between representations. It can be implemented using standard functions and a standard scripting language in any raster or vector GIS. We present the results of a test using data from the Digital Chart of the World.},

Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to decide how a task should be dispatched through the network due to the high diversity of the communities and the dynamically changing expertise and social availability of their members. We introduce CrowdSTAR, a framework designed to route tasks across and within online crowds. CrowdSTAR indexes the topic-specific expertise and social features of the crowd contributors and then uses a routing algorithm, which sug- gests the best sources to ask based on the knowledge vs. availability trade-offs. We experimented with the proposed framework for question and answering scenarios by using two popular social networks as crowd candidates: Twitter and Quora.},

Generally, a worker has a certain level of confidence in the correctness of her answers, and asking about it is useful for estimating the probability of correctness. However, we need to overcome two main obstacles to utilize confidence for inferring correct answers. One is that a worker is not always well-calibrated. Since she is sometimes over/underconfident, her confidence does not always coincide with the probability of correctness. The other is that she does not always truthfully report her confidence. Thus, we design an indirect mechanism that enables a worker to declare her confidence by choosing a desirable reward plan from the set of plans that correspond to different confidence intervals. Our mechanism ensures that choosing a plan including true confidence maximizes the worker's expected utility. We also propose a method that composes a set of plans that can achieve requester-specified accuracy in estimating the correct answer using a small number of workers. We show our experimental results using Amazon Mechanical Turk.},

abstract = {A group of agents are said to collude if they share information or make joint decisions in a manner contrary to explicit or implicit social rules that results in an unfair advantage over non-colluding agents or other interested parties. For instance, collusion manifests as sharing answers in exams, as colluding bidders in auctions, or as colluding participants (e.g., Turkers) in crowd sourcing. This paper studies the latter, where the goal of the colluding participants is to "earn" money without doing the actual work, for instance by copying product ratings of another colluding participant, adding limited noise as attempted obfuscation. Such collusion not only yields fewer independent ratings, but may also introduce strong biases in aggregate results if undetected. Our proposed unsupervised collusion detection algorithm identifies colluding groups in crowd sourcing with fairly high accuracy both in synthetic and real data, and results in significant bias reduction, such as minimizing shifts from the true mean in rating tasks and recovering the true variance among raters.},

We characterize the accuracy of predictions with respect to different sets of features that describe user behavior and study the sensitivity of predictions to variations in the amount of data and retraining.

abstract = {The recent advent of human computation -- employing non-experts to solve problems -- has inspired theoretical work in mechanism design for eliciting information when responses cannot be verified. We study a popular practical method, output agreement, from a theoretical perspective. In output agreement, two agents are given the same inputs and asked to produce some output; they are scored based on how closely their responses agree. Although simple, output agreement raises new conceptual questions. Primary is the fundamental importance of common knowledge: We show that, rather than being truthful, output agreement mechanisms elicit common knowledge from participants. We show that common knowledge is essentially the best that can be hoped for in any mechanism without verification unless there are restrictions on the information structure. This involves generalizing truthfulness to include responding to a query rather than simply reporting a private signal, along with a notion of common-knowledge equilibria. A final important issue raised by output agreement is focal equilibria and player computation of equilibria. We show that, for eliciting the mean of a random variable, a natural player inference process converges to the common-knowledge equilibrium; but this convergence may not occur for other types of queries.},

abstract = {CrowdBand, a sound composition system, demonstrates how a crowd can create works that meet requested criteria and fulfill the aesthetic character given by keyword description and examples. CrowdBand allows flexibility in music composition in terms of duration of the music, completion time and cost of music composition by giving the requestor two modes - thrifty and normal. CrowdBand{\textquoteright}s workflow divides the composition task into three sections: requesting fundamental sounds, assembling sounds into compositions, and evaluating the results. Based on the crowd workers{\textquoteright} responses, we conclude that crowdsourced workers who are non-musicians can design sound and create novel sound compositions through CrowdBand. We also conclude that CrowdBand gives the musically-untrained crowd workers the ability to use common compositional techniques, such as sound layering, vertical stacking of sounds to create harmonic effects, related melodic lines (contrapuntal techniques), and transitions between aesthetic notions, or sound themes. Finally, we show improved, faster results with successive simplification and examples.},

abstract = {Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are commonly used to disseminate up-to-date news information, but they also contain a lot of noise and irrelevant content. The contents of social media platforms are typically filtered by followship or friendship oriented relationships, and is almost always driven by trending news topics at the national scale, making it difficult for users to gather useful information that is most pertinent to a local community context. Research has utilized content analysis techniques to gain insights on the sentiment expressed about political topics on social media sites. However, there has been little attempt to understand how users would perceive this information if opinions and sentiments about news topics were externalized and made aware to them. We designed Community Poll, a smartphone application that aggregates local news feeds with relevant tweets about the local news topics. A Public Attitude Meter is calculated based on the sentiment score of the tweets for each of the local news topic presented in the system. We conducted a 2-week deployment with 16 users about their perception of the system. The users reported that Community Poll helps them digest locally relevant news topics, and quickly gather public opinions associated with the topics. They reported that being aware of public sentiment encouraged them to more actively participate in discussions on social media. Curiosity about a score-based representation is an important element that drove them to consume local news topics that they wouldn{\textquoteright}t otherwise be exposed to. Interestingly, although being aware of public sentiment served to reaffirm people{\textquoteright}s positions on the local topics, users expressed concerns about how sentiment awareness might bias other people{\textquoteright}s judgments regarding news topics.},

A novel corpus of YouTube video reviews was created, and sentiment judgments were obtained via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We created a system for isolating text, video, and audio modalities from YouTube videos to ensure that annotators could only see the particular modality or modalities being evaluated. Reliability of judgments was assessed using Fleiss Kappa inter-annotator agreement values. We found that the audio only modality produced the most reliable judgments for video fragments and that across modalities video fragments are less ambiguous than full videos.},

While social media is a valuable tool for outreach and the sharing of ideas, there is a danger that this form of communication is gaining too high a value and that we are losing sight of key metrics of scientific value, such as citation indices. To help quantify this, I propose the 'Kardashian Index', a measure of discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record based on the direct comparison of numbers of citations and Twitter followers.},

Wish contributes a new approach to crowdsourcing complex work. Rather than combining pools of unskilled workers to producing complex output, Wish uses the crowd to identify and recruit a pool of experts, then assigns a single high-quality expert to carry out the task. ~This approach retains the benefits of using a crowd {\textemdash}~scalability, speed, correctness, and responsiveness {\textemdash} while simplifying the process of crowdsourcing complex work. We demonstrate Wish in the context of three prototype tools. ~ Draft enables users to consult a crowd of authors for suggestions on writing. ~ Hack lets developers convert pseudocode into working code by pulling results on demand from a crowd of programmers.~ Sketch lets individuals convert rough sketches into fully-refined art by consulting artists.~ We illustrate how novice creators can use Wish to amplify their ability, how expert designers can use Wish to explore design spaces and improve the speed of creation, and how new users can use Wish to gain feedback from experts.},

abstract = {Word-of-mouth, referral, or viral marketing is a highly sought-after way of advertising. In this paper, we investigate whether such marketing can be encouraged through incentive mechanisms, thus allowing an organisation to effectively crowdsource their marketing. Specifically, we undertake a field experiment that compares several mechanisms for incentivising social media shares in support of a charitable cause. Our experiment takes place on a website promoting a fundraising drive by a large cancer research charity. Site visitors who sign up to support the cause are asked to spread the word about it on Facebook, Twitter or other channels. They are randomly assigned to one of four treatments that differ in the way social sharing activities are incentivised. Under the control treatment, no extra incentive is provided. Under two of the other mechanisms, the sharers are offered a fixed number of points that help take the campaign further. We compare low and high levels of such incentives for direct referrals. In the final treatment, we adopt a multi-level incentive mechanism that rewards direct as well as indirect referrals (where referred contacts refer others). We find that providing a high level of incentives results in a statistically significant increase in sharing behaviour and resulting signups. Our data does not indicate a statistically significant increase for the low and multi-level incentive mechanisms.},

abstract = {Paid crowd work offers remarkable opportunities for improving productivity, social mobility, and the global economy by engaging a geographically distributed workforce to complete complex tasks on demand and at scale. But it is also possible that crowd work will fail to achieve its potential, focusing on assembly-line piecework. Can we foresee a future crowd workplace in which we would want our children to participate? This paper frames the major challenges that stand in the way of this goal. Drawing on theory from organizational behavior and distributed computing, as well as direct feedback from workers, we outline a framework that will enable crowd work that is complex, collaborative, and sustainable. The framework lays out research challenges in twelve major areas: workflow, task assignment, hierarchy, real-time response, synchronous collaboration, quality control, crowds guiding AIs, AIs guiding crowds, platforms, job design, reputation, and motivation.},

While strides have been made in algorithmic approaches to personalization, most require access to a significant amount of data. However, even when data is limited online crowds can be used to infer an individual{\textquoteright}s personal preferences. Aided by the diversity of tastes among online crowds and their ability to understand others, we show that crowdsourcing is an effective on-demand tool for personalization. Unlike typical crowdsourcing approaches that seek a ground truth, we present and evaluate two crowdsourcing approaches designed to capture personal preferences. The first, taste-matching , identifies workers with similar taste to the requester and uses their taste to infer the requester{\textquoteright}s taste. The second, taste-grokking , asks workers to explicitly predict the requester{\textquoteright}s taste based on training examples. These techniques are evaluated on two subjective tasks, personalized image recommendation and tailored textual summaries. Taste-matching and taste-grokking both show improvement over the use of generic workers, and have different benefits and drawbacks depending on the complexity of the task and the variability of the taste space.},

Accordingly, this paper argues that these new tools should not remain the preserve of restricted government, scientific or corporate {\'e}lites, but be opened up for societal engagement and critique. To democratise such assets as a public good, requires a sustainable ecosystem enabling different kinds of stakeholder in society, including but not limited to, citizens and advocacy groups, school and university students, policy analysts, scientists, software developers, journalists and politicians. Our working name for envisioning a sociotechnical infrastructure capable of engaging such a wide constituency is the Global Participatory Platform (GPP). We consider what it means to develop a GPP at the different levels of data, models and deliberation, motivating a framework for different stakeholders to find their ecological niches at different levels within the system, serving the functions of (i) sensing the environment in order to pool data, (ii) mining the resulting data for patterns in order to model the past/present/future, and (iii) sharing and contesting possible interpretations of what those models might mean, and in a policy context, possible decisions. A research objective is also to apply the concepts and tools of complexity science and social science to the project{\textquoteright}s own work. We therefore conceive the global participatory platform as a resilient, epistemic ecosystem, whose design will make it capable of self-organization and adaptation to a dynamic environment, and whose structure and contributions are themselves networks of stakeholders, challenges, issues, ideas and arguments whose structure and dynamics can be modelled and analysed.},

abstract = {Programming by Demonstration (PbD) can allow end-users to teach robots new actions simply by demonstrating them. However, learning generalizable actions requires a large number of demonstrations that is unreasonable to expect from end-users. In this paper, we explore the idea of using crowdsourcing to collect action demonstrations from the crowd. We propose a PbD framework in which the end-user provides an initial seed demonstration, and then the robot searches for scenarios in which the action will not work and requests the crowd to fix the action for these scenarios. We use instance-based learning with a simple yet powerful action representation that allows an intuitive visualization of the action. Crowd workers directly interact with these visualizations to fix them. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a user study involving local crowd workers (N=31) and analyze the collected data and the impact of alternative design parameters so as to inform a real-world deployment of our system.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of large-scale mobile crowd- tasking, where a large pool of citizen crowd-workers are used to perform a variety of location-specific urban logis- tics tasks. Current approaches to such mobile crowd-tasking are very decentralized: a crowd-tasking platform usually pro- vides each worker a set of available tasks close to the worker{\textquoteright}s current location; each worker then independently chooses which tasks she wants to accept and perform. In contrast, we propose TRACCS, a more coordinated task assignment ap- proach, where the crowd-tasking platform assigns a sequence of tasks to each worker, taking into account their expected location trajectory over a wider time horizon, as opposed to just instantaneous location. We formulate such task assign- ment as an optimization problem, that seeks to maximize the total payoff from all assigned tasks, subject to a maximum bound on the detour (from the expected path) that a worker will experience to complete her assigned tasks. We develop credible computationally-efficient heuristics to address this optimization problem (whose exact solution requires solving a complex integer linear program), and show, via simulations with realistic topologies and commuting patterns, that a spe- cific heuristic (called Greedy-ILS) increases the fraction of assigned tasks by more than 20%, and reduces the average detour overhead by more than 60%, compared to the current decentralized approach.},

abstract = {The power of human computation is founded on the capabilities of humans to process qualitative information in a manner that is hard to reproduce with a computer. However, all machine learning algorithms rely on mathematical operations, such as sums, averages, least squares etc. that are less suitable for human computation. This paper is an effort to combine these two aspects of data processing. We consider the problem of computing a centroid of a data set, a key component in many data-analysis applications such as clustering, using a very simple human intelligence task (HIT). In this task the workers must choose the outlier from a set of three items. After presenting a number of such triplets to the workers, the item chosen the least number of times as the outlier is selected as the centroid. We provide a proof that the centroid determined by this procedure is equal the mean of a univariate normal distribution. Furthermore, as a demonstration of the viability of our method, we implement a human computation based variant of the k-means clustering algorithm. We present experiments where the proposed method is used to find an "average" image in a collection, and cluster images to semantic categories.},

abstract = {While many Web 2.0-inspired approaches to semantic content authoring do acknowledge motivation and incentives as the main drivers of user involvement, the amount of useful human contributions actually available will always remain a scarce resource. Complementarily, there are aspects of semantic content authoring in which automatic techniques have proven to perform reliably, and the added value of human (and collective) intelligence is often a question of cost and timing. The challenge that this book attempts to tackle is how these two approaches (machine- and human-driven computation) could be combined in order to improve the cost-performance ratio of creating, managing, and meaningfully using semantic content. To do so, we need to first understand how theories and practices from social sciences and economics about user behavior and incentives could be applied to semantic content authoring. We will introduce a methodology to help software designers to embed incentives-minded functionalities into semantic applications, as well as best practices and guidelines. We will present several examples of such applications, addressing tasks such as ontology management, media annotation, and information extraction, which have been built with these considerations in mind. These examples illustrate key design issues of incentivized Semantic Web applications that might have a significant effect on the success and sustainable development of the applications: the suitability of the task and knowledge domain to the intended audience, and the mechanisms set up to ensure high-quality contributions, and extensive user involvement.},

abstract = {Creating sessions of related papers for a large conference is a complex and time-consuming task. Traditionally, a few conference organizers group papers into sessions manually. Organizers often fail to capture the affinities between papers beyond created sessions, making incoherent sessions difficult to fix and alternative groupings hard to discover. This paper proposes committeesourcing and authorsourcing approaches to session creation (a specific instance of clustering and constraint satisfaction) that tap into the expertise and interest of committee members and authors for identifying paper affinities. During the planning of ACM CHI'13, a large conference on human-computer interaction, we recruited committee members to group papers using two online distributed clustering methods. To refine these paper affinities {\textemdash} and to evaluate the committeesourcing methods against existing manual and automated approaches {\textemdash} we recruited authors to identify papers that fit well in a session with their own. Results show that authors found papers grouped by the distributed clustering methods to be as relevant as, or more relevant than, papers suggested through the existing in-person meeting. Results also demonstrate that communitysourced results capture affinities beyond sessions and provide flexibility during scheduling.},

abstract = {The growing availability of spatial data along with growing ease to use the spatial data (thanks to wide-scale adoption of GIS) have made it possible to use spatial data in applications inappropriate considering the quality of the data. As a result, concerns about spatial data quality have increased. To deal with these concerns, it is necessary to (1) formalise and standardise descriptions of spatial data quality and (2) to apply these descriptions in assessing the suitability (fitness for use) of spatial data, before using the data. The aim of this thesis was twofold: (1) to enhance the description of spatial data quality and (2) to improve our understanding of the implications of spatial data quality.</span><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB>Chapter 1 sets the scene with a discussion on uncertainty and an explanation of why concerns about spatial data quality exist. Knowledge gaps are identified and the chapter concludes with six research questions.</span><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB>Chapter 2 presents an overview of definitions of spatial data quality. Overall, I found a strong agreement on which elements together define spatial data quality. Definitions appear to differ in two aspects: (1) the location within the meta-data report: some elements occur not in the spatial data quality section but in another section of the meta-data report; and (2) the explicitness with which elements are recognised as individual elements. For example, the European pre-standard explicitly recognises the<span class=GramE>element</span>'homogeneity'. Other standards recognise the importance of documenting the variation in quality, without naming it explicitly as an individual element.</span><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB>In chapter 3 we quantified the spatial variability in classification accuracy for the agricultural crops in the Dutch national land cover database (LGN). Classification accuracy was significantly correlated with: (1) the crop present according to LGN, (2) the homogeneity of the 8-cell neighbourhood around each cell, (3) the size of the patch in which a cell is located, and (4) the heterogeneity of the landscape in which a cell is located.</span><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB>In chapter 4 I present methods that use error matrices and change detection error matrices as input to make more accurate land cover change estimates. It was shown that temporal correlation in classification errors has a significant impact and must be taken into account. Producers of time series land cover data are recommended not only to report error matrices, but also change detection error matrices.</span><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB>Chapter 5 focuses on positional accuracy and area estimates. From the positional accuracy of vertices delineating polygons, the variance and covariance in area can be derived. Earlier studies derived equations for the<span class=GramE>variance,</span>this chapter presents a covariance equation. The variance and covariance equation were implemented in a model and applied in a case-study. The case-study consisted of 97 polygons with a small subsidy value (in euros per hectare) assigned to each polygon. With the model we could calculate the uncertainty in the total subsidy value (in euros) of the complete set of polygons as a consequence of uncertainty in the position of vertices.</span><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm;mso-outline-level:1'><span lang=EN-GB>Chapter 6 explores the relationship between completeness of spatial data and risk in digging activities around underground cables and pipelines. A model is presented for calculating the economic implications of over- and incompleteness. An important element of this model is the</span><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>relationship between detection time and costs. The model can be used to calculate the optimal detection time, i.e. the time at which expected costs are at their minimum.<o:p></o:p></span><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm;mso-outline-level:1'><span lang=EN-GB>Chapter 7 addresses the question why risk analysis (RA) is so rarely applied to assess the suitability of spatial data prior to using the data. In theory, the use of RA is beneficial because it allows the user to judge if the use of certain spatial data does not produce unacceptable risks. Frequently proposed hypotheses explaining the scarce adoption of RA are all technical and educational. In chapter 7 we propose a new group of hypotheses, based on decision theory. We found that the willingness to spend resources on RA depends (1) on the presence of feedback mechanisms in the decision-making process, (2) on how much is at stake and (3) to a minor extent on how well the decision-making process can be modelled.</span><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><o:p></o:p></span><p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB>Chapter 8 presents conclusions on the six research questions (chapters 2-7) and lists recommendations for users, producers and researchers of spatial data. With regard to the description, four recommendations are given. Firstly, spend more effort on documenting the lineage of reference data. Secondly, quantify and report correlation of quality between related data sets. Thirdly, investigate the integration of different forms of uncertainty (error, vagueness, ambiguity). Fourthly, study the implementation and use of spatial data quality standards. With regard to the application of spatial data quality descriptions, I have two main recommendations. Firstly, to continue the line of research followed in this thesis: quantification of implications of spatial data quality, through development of theory along with tangible illustrations in case-studies. Secondly, there is a need for more empirical research into how users cope with spatial data quality.},
